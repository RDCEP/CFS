* CFS: Download data from the CFS archive and CFS2 rolling updates.

This is a collection of scripts for downloading data from both the CFS
(Climate Forecast System) archive and the CFS2 rolling updates.
Currently we are downloading a subset of CFS2 for the 1st and 15th
day of each month.

Scripts are tailored for clusters running SLURM but easily adapted to
any system.
